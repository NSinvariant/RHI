Repository for code accompanying paper "The computational refined Humbert invariant problem is equivalent to the computational isogeny problem"

This repository contains two short magma files which can both be ran in the online calculator https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/.

This is code to verify the correctness of Algorithm 1 in the paper to compute the basis of a quaternion order given its norm form.
